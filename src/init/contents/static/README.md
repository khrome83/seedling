# Static Files

Any file places in this folder will be served from the root of the exported site and during development.

> Seedling currently does _Not_ modify the files in the /static directory.

## Suggestions

1. Add a `manifest.json` to supply the browser with the info for a Progressive Web App.
2. Don't forget a `favicon.ico` to give your browser tab the much needed love.
3. Spice things up with some special social images to add to your open graph data.
4. Add any images needed around the site.
